  "exp_comment": "* Augmentation Reinforced\n  - Image Blur Feature Added \n* New Exp on exp Lr\n  - Due to frequent network error, there was unexpected termination over the last two exp. \n  - This makes hard to observe the behavior of exponetial decay lr scheduling.\n  - So, this time, we decided to start it over gain, \n  -  Also, we change the decay_steps from 1.0 to .6 (hard coded value), which makes lr curve more steeper .\n",
