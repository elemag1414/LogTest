  "exp_comment": "* Augmentation Reinforced\n  - Image Blur Feature Added \n* New Exp on Cos Lr\n  - Due to frequent network error, there was unexpected termination over the last two exp. \n  - This makes hard to observe the behavior of cos annealing lr scheduling.\n  - So, this time, we decided to start it over gain, \n  -  Also, we change the n_cycles from num_epochs/100 to 2.5 (hard coded value).\n  - n_cycles changed from 2.5 to 2\n",
